# 🤖☀️ AI-Based Solar-Powered Smart Hat

This project is a smart wearable hat powered by solar energy and enhanced with AI-based features. Designed for real-time environmental monitoring, health tracking, and user comfort, the smart hat represents an innovative blend of renewable energy and artificial intelligence.

## 🌟 Features

- ☀️ **Solar Power**: Charges and powers the onboard electronics using flexible solar panels.
- 🤖 **AI Integration**: Uses AI algorithms for decision-making, anomaly detection, or user interaction.
- 🌡️ **Environmental Sensors**: Monitors temperature, humidity, UV index, or air quality.
- 🧠 **Health Monitoring** *(Optional)*: Tracks body temperature, heart rate, or fatigue using wearable biosensors.
- 📡 **Wireless Connectivity**: Sends data to a mobile device or cloud platform via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.
- 🔋 **Battery Management**: Efficient energy storage and usage system using microcontrollers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Microcontroller**: Arduino / ESP32 / Raspberry Pi Pico (customizable)
- **Power Source**: Flexible solar panels + rechargeable Li-ion battery
- **Sensors**: DHT11/22, UV sensor, pulse sensor, etc.
- **AI Model**: Trained using Python (scikit-learn/TensorFlow) or deployed using Edge AI tools
- **Communication**: Bluetooth / Wi-Fi
- **Software**: Arduino IDE, Python, TensorFlow Lite, etc.

## 📦 Hardware Components

| Component              | Description                            |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Solar Panel            | Powers the system                      |
| Microcontroller        | Controls and processes data            |
| Sensors                | Environmental and health sensors       |
| Rechargeable Battery   | Stores solar energy                    |
| Hat Frame              | Base wearable unit                     |

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Solar Charging**: Solar panels charge the battery during sunlight exposure.
2. **Sensor Input**: Environmental and/or biometric data is collected.
3. **AI Processing**: Data is processed using onboard or edge AI for predictions or alerts.
4. **User Feedback**: Output is displayed via LEDs, buzzers, or mobile app.
